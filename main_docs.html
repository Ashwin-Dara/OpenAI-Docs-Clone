            <h2> Key Concepts and Terminology </h2>

            <p>
                The main characters of RL are the agent and the environment. The environment is the world that the agent lives in and interacts with. At every step of interaction, the agent sees a (possibly partial) observation of the state of the world, and then decides on an action to take. The environment changes when the agent acts on it, but may also change on its own.

            </p>
            <h3>
                Rewarding
            </h3>
            <p>
                The agent also perceives a reward signal from the environment, a number that tells it how good or bad the current world state is. The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward, called return. Reinforcement learning methods are ways that the agent can learn behaviors to achieve its goal.

            </p>
            <h3> Further Reading </h3>
            <p>
                To talk more specifically what RL does, we need to introduce additional terminology. We need to talk about
