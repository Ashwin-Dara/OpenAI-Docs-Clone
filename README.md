# OpenAI-Docs-Clone
Using HTML and CSS, mimicked the layout of the OpenAI API webpage to practice frontend designing (beta.openai.com). This readme will first contain a brief overview of the website and then discuss reflections about the development of the project. 

## Overview of Site

## Reflections 

### 1. Planning / Categorizing: 
All of the code for the frontend was written essentially on the fly. In other words, what is meant by this that the code was written while viewing the website. There was not much thought put into the actual layout of what I was seeing, nor was there enough thought put into the "workflow" of the code. Personally, if I could restart this, the single most important thing I realize I could have done is first categorize the design and elements with the same/similar styling. This way, when writing the code, the classes / ids within HtML would encompass multiple elements that are similar. This would have significantly reduced the amount of code that would have been written. 

- TLDR: LOOK AT THE WEBSITE. CATEGORIZE ELEMENTS. BE INTENTIONAL WITH DIVS. HAVE A PLAN.

### 2. Refactoring and Naming Conventions: 
Typically, when writing other projects, I aim to refactor / review the past code every ~400 lines or so. However, since the project was ~800 lines of code, I felt as if refactoring was unnecessary. Since this will not be expanded nor reused, not refactoring is something that could be got away with. However, working on larger codebases will defintely require reviewing previous code segments. 

- TLDR: IN LARGER PROJECTS, REFACTORING IS NEEDED. ALSO, NAMINg CONVENTION IN CLASSES SHOULD BE BETTER. 

### 3. Consistency:
Being inconsistent with this project required it to take a lot longer. Moreover, between especially longer breaks, it was more difficult to resume flow from last time. I also realize that refactoring would have been able to solve this issue of "losing flow." 

- TLDR: BE CONSISTENT WITH WORK
